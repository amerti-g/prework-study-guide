# PREWORK STUDY GUIDE WEBPAGE

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

my motivation is to be excellent in what i'm learning.
because it ia a way to accomplish why i'm in the bootcamp and that is learning.
since i'm learning from the scratch pretty much everything was new to me.
